# Ecomanda Delivery

Ecomanda Delivery is an integration hub for WhatsApp, chat platforms, and chatbots.
It receives inbound webhooks, persists the raw payloads, processes them through BullMQ
workers, and routes outbound messages to the configured provider plugins.

## Current Status

This is an active refactoring codebase. The backend and frontend still run locally, and
the repo now also includes a scripted smoke workflow for pre-deploy verification.

Main runtime pieces:

- Express API in [server.js](server.js)
- BullMQ worker in [worker.js](worker.js)
- React + Vite frontend in [client](client)
- MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ for local/dev infrastructure

## Stack

- Node.js `24.x` (`.tool-versions` currently pins `24.5.0`)
- Yarn `1.22.x`
- Express `5`
- Mongoose + MongoDB
- BullMQ + Redis
- React `19` + Vite
- Jest for backend tests
- Vitest for frontend tests

## Requirements

- `node` `24.x`
- `yarn`
- `docker` with `docker compose`
- `asdf` is optional, but the repo already includes `.tool-versions`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
cd client && yarn install
```

2. Create the backend env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Fill the required values in `.env`, especially:

- `SECRET`
- `DEFAULT_USER`
- `DEFAULT_PASSWORD`
- AWS variables if you need backup/storage flows

## Local Development

### Backend + Worker

```bash
yarn dev
```

What this does:

- starts Docker infra through `docker compose up -d`
- runs the Express server with `nodemon`
- runs the worker with `nodemon`

If you only want one side:

```bash
yarn dev:server
yarn dev:worker
```

The production-style server entrypoint is:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
yarn start
```

Notes:

- the frontend uses Vite, not CRA
- Vite defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- `/login` and `/resources` are proxied to `API_PROXY_TARGET`
- if `API_PROXY_TARGET` is unset, Vite falls back to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

### Infra Only

If you want the supporting services without starting the app process through `yarn dev`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:

- `mongo`
- `mongo-express`
- `redis`
- `rabbitmq`

## Pre-Deploy Local Smoke Workflow

The repo includes a hybrid smoke workflow that runs the backend stack in Docker and the
frontend on the host, then verifies the core app flows without hitting real providers.

```bash
cp .env.smoke.example .env.smoke
yarn smoke:start
yarn smoke:check
yarn smoke:stop
```

What it verifies:

- frontend responds
- `POST /login` works
- authenticated `/resources` access works
- `messenger -> worker -> chat` flow works against local provider doubles
- `chat -> worker -> messenger` flow works against local provider doubles

See [docs/kb/features/local-smoke-workflow.md](docs/kb/features/local-smoke-workflow.md)
for the full topology and troubleshooting notes.

| `yarn smoke:start` | Start the smoke topology and seed demo data |
| `yarn smoke:check` | Verify the smoke flows end to end |
| `yarn smoke:stop` | Stop the smoke topology |

### Frontend Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|

## Architecture Notes

- Incoming provider webhooks hit `/api/v1/*`
- Controllers enqueue or persist the inbound payloads
- BullMQ workers process the domain flow asynchronously
- Plugins in `src/app/plugins` adapt each provider
- The admin/resource API lives under `/resources/*`

## Refactoring Themes

The main ongoing improvement areas in this repo are:

- reducing MongoDB coupling
- extracting use-case logic from controllers
- tightening testability around queues and integrations
- cleaning up legacy plugins and unused code paths
- improving architecture boundaries before any larger migration to TypeScript
