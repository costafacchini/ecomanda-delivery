# Plans

Git-native Markdown plans for multi-step work.

```

**Lifecycle**: not-started → in-progress → complete
**Skills**: `create-plan`, `execute-task`, `execute-plan`
**Rule**: Each task completable in one session. No file ownership overlaps.

## Execution Order

```
use-cases (complete) → js-to-ts (complete)
                              ↓
                       remove-pdv → mongo-to-postgres
```

`remove-pdv` should complete before `type-backend` / `type-client` to avoid typing code that will be deleted.
`security-hardening`, `baileys-socket-monitor`, `local-chat-infra`, and `setores` are independent and can run in parallel.
